					<p>The idea of miraculous fountains, (originating probably in the physical effects of some waters,) seems to have been a favourite classical fiction, as exemplified in the two springs in Boeotia, of which one was supposed to increase, and the other to take away, the memory. The belief in these was rife during the middle ages, and indeed extended to a later period; as we find the early discoverers reported, among other wonders, a fountain of youth.</p>
					<p>It is possible, moreover, that with the idea of Claudian’s two fountains may have been mixed up that of Cupid’s two arrows, one of lead and the other of gold; of which the golden one was supposed to instil love, and the leaden hate. <a href="canto-1.xhtml#noteref-20" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

The English archer (at least latterly) was mounted; but made use of his horse only as a vehicle, as originally was the practice of the dragoon, who, when in action, fought as a foot-soldier. The English archers, indeed, were the yeomanry of the country, and wholly unlike the naked rabble of peasants, who composed the infantry of the other European nations. Hence they were allowed one horse per man (as we find in Anderson’s History of Commerce), and sixpence a day, at the time of the battle of Agincourt, being one half of the pay of the esquire or man-at-arms: an allowance which, notwithstanding the depreciation of money, continued to be the stipend of our foot-soldier till within these few years. <a href="canto-10.xhtml#noteref-139" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>We have here a short but sufficiently precise description of the chieftain of a clan, whether highlander or borderer: for it is to be observed, that the southern provinces of Scotland, and indeed the neighbouring English counties, afforded the same examples of such a patriarchal species of authority. This seems to have been clearly of Celtic origin: for the English and Scottish borders were, as well as the highlands, peopled by a tribe of this race, the remnants of Arthur’s kingdom, which extended as far as from North Wales to Cumberland in England, and the parallel counties in Scotland. The cause, however, of clanship being <em>maintained</em> in this line, as well as in the Highlands, is probably to be found in the analogous state of society presented by both districts. Such a custom as clanship would hardly be preserved in any country, after the necessity for it had ceased. Now this <em>had</em> ceased under the increasing civilization of the other Celtic provinces; but was yet in force in those, whose pacification had been retarded by moral or physical accidents. In these, clanship was the best protection which could be had in a state of <em>neighbour warfare</em>.</p>
					<p>It may excite surprise that no mention is anywhere made of the Highland garb, which might have been turned to some account in this picture; but it must be recollected that the Highlanders do not appear to have been much considered in the time of Ariosto; and indeed may be said to have first risen into consideration by the glorious part they played in Montrose’s wars. <a href="canto-10.xhtml#noteref-140" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

One of the late translators of the Furioso, in commenting upon this canto of his author’s seems here to think him indefensible; and what would justly be thought so glaring an offence against costume in a modern, will probably be deemed in the eyes of many, a defect in Ariosto. But those many, who judge by rule, should, on their own principles, have regard to authority: and by what many and weighty authorities may he not be justified? To come near to our own times; is not the mixture in Lycidas, of “the pilot of the Galilean lake,” and of heathen gods and goddesses, “Sleek Panope, with all her sisters,” and “old Hippotades,” shepherds and bishops, a more anomalous assemblage than that which we find in the story of Olympia?

Beyond this work, it seems, was a second wall, or dyke, divided from the first by a <em>dry</em> ditch, into which Rodomont drives his party of assailants, urging them to the assault of the interior wall, and he himself leaping the ditch, and, like Alexander at the siege of Oxydracae, mounting the last defence, and springing from it into the city. His followers, in the meantime, while planting their ladders against the interior wall in this second moat, are consumed by combustibles, with which it had been previously filled by the Parisians. Rodomont, it is to be recollected, had escaped the effects of the explosion by his desperate leap, and is left enclosed in the middle of the city. <a href="canto-14.xhtml#noteref-193" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

This discrimination appears to me strikingly exemplified in the character of his two viragos. Bradamant and Marphisa, though equally brave, and, by the vagrant and unfeminine life which they lead, equally subjected to the same coarse suspicions, always appear to us in very different lights. The mere circumstance of his having armed one with a golden spear, with which she tilts her enemies out of their saddles, and the other with a sabre to hack and hew, makes all the difference.

They are not, after all, so bad a substitute for something better, as might be conceived; and the mountain peasantry of warm countries (to their praise be it spoken!) will accommodate themselves to worse provision. The inhabitants of the Tuscan Apennines make the fruit of the <em>wild chestnut</em> (I am not sure that it is the same as our horse chestnut) and ground pulse into bread; and the traveller, in a season of scarcity, may find beech leaves boiling in their pots, as an esculent vegetable. <a href="canto-24.xhtml#noteref-277" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>The succeeding stanzas (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">LXV</span> to <span epub:type="z3998:roman">LXIX</span>) which I have omitted, were (we are assured by the brother of the poet) condemned on that revision of his work which was made by him with a view to a more perfect edition; and this tends strongly to prove that Ariosto must have somewhat outrun the gross and licentious spirit of his age. English critics are disposed to believe that this was much more outrageous in Italy than in England, and the writer of an article upon my translation in the Quarterly Review attributes this to the supposed licentiousness which succeeded the great plague at Florence, Reasoning, however, as all our commentators do, from the great scandal afforded by Italian literature of this period, he overlooks <em>that</em> given by our own writers. Harrington’s translation of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Furioso</i>, dedicated to a virgin queen, is to the full as licentious as his original, and sometimes infinitely more coarse. As a proof of this, he has in the most scandalous episode which is contained in Ariosto’s work used a word so offensive (not printed, indeed, for a blank space is left for it, but indicated by a corresponding double rhyme), that I question whether it would not almost scandalize even the male population of Wapping and <abbr>St.</abbr> Giles’s. Nor will the plea of “<i xml:lang="la">non meus hic sermo</i>” excuse our poets of that time: for original writers as well as translators may be cited in proof of English delinquency; and Shakespeare’s “Venus and Adonis” presents as many voluptuous pictures as the prose of Boccaccio or the poetry of Ariosto. <a href="canto-25.xhtml#noteref-289" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>All the commentators have explained this monster to mean Avarice, which had overrun the Christian world. Sir John Harrington, who lived in an age of allegory, says, that Ariosto describes this vice very significantly; he makes “her ugly, because of all vices it is most hateful; ears of an ass, being for the most part ignorant, or at least careless of other men’s good opinions; a wolf in head and breast, namely, ravenous and never satisfied; a lion’s grisly jaw, terrible and devouring; a fox in all the rest, wily and crafty.”</p>
					<p>He might have brought other proofs in support of his opinion, as the scandal which the Beast had brought upon the papal court, and as arrogating to itself the keys of Heaven, <abbr>etc.</abbr> in which Ariosto (who, as has been said, though a Catholic, was no Papist) manifestly satirizes the sale of indulgences.

					<p>Though this episode is distinguished by that felicity of expression and neatness of narration so peculiarly characteristic of Ariosto, I cannot think it deserving of all the encomiums which have been bestowed upon it. It is, as I conceive, deficient in that dramatic truth which is equally characteristic of his style, and is generally so well observed by him. What, for instance, can be more extravagant than the conception of the leading incident? We may almost say, that extreme hypocrisy and extreme debauchery are never found together; for there are always some dregs of truth, however muddy, at the bottom of hypocrisy. If this be true, the character of the wife is not in nature; but supposing her character to be in nature, how can we imagine that a husband, who was tied to her apron-string, should never have entertained the least suspicion of her perverse predilection? Is it not yet more extravagant to suppose that this abused husband, who had surprised her in <i xml:lang="la">flagranti delicto</i>, and who was at first about to kill both her and her paramour, should be seized with such a sudden qualm of morbid sensibility as not even to disturb her slumbers?</p>
					<p>The last act of extravagance in this little piece, the return of king and cavalier to the adulteresses, with whom they live very happy ever afterwards, is less out of nature, and is besides justified by its epigrammatic spirit. <a href="canto-28.xhtml#noteref-358" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>That there are some preparations which for a time secure the skin from fire there is no doubt, and we cannot much wonder it should have been believed in a more ignorant age, that what preserved from one danger would preserve from another. In Constantinople, where things have remained (as has been before said) much in the same state as they were in Christendom down to the fifteenth century, a frequent exhibition takes place of dervishes who handle red hot irons with impunity; and every now and then we have some chance performer on the same strange instruments at home.</p>
					<p>In these performances there may be some trick, as in the apparent swallowing of molten lead, which is probably some other composite metal capable of fusion by an inferior degree of heat, a thing which is sometimes witnessed in the partial dissolution of an alehouse teaspoon in a hot cup of tea; but making every reasonable allowance for deception, no one can doubt the main fact, who has witnessed these performances, which certainly offer a reasonable ground for believing that all the strange tricks of natural magic which we read of in works of the middle ages were not such mere hocus pocus as our modern natural philosophers would persuade us; and the thing on which I have been commenting may show how oddly secrets may be preserved among the ignorant, which elude all the researches of the educated. <a href="canto-29.xhtml#noteref-359" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>An Italian commentator attacks Ariosto for having first stated that one nameless herb, boiled with rue and ivy, was sufficient for Isabella’s purpose, and then for making her collect many others for this magic bath. I should not have thought the criticism worth notice, if the circumstance did not illustrate a fact in the history of manners, or rather of art. In the earlier ages of Europe, all composers of medicine dealt largely in compound drugs, and never used that on which they most relied without other auxiliary ingredients. The great improvers of medicine were inclined to treat this complication of remedies as an imposture. But better experience seems to prove that our ancestors were right in the principle, however inefficient or erroneous may have been their practice. For it is now well ascertained that the happy union of drugs is one of the most useful points of medicine; and that even preparations of the same ingredient which offend when taken separately, will sometimes produce a beneficial effect when administered in combination. <a href="canto-29.xhtml#noteref-360" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>The English reader can only find some palliation for this passage in the spirit of Ariosto’s age and country. As a specimen, indeed, of the different feeling with which his countrymen have contemplated it, it is enough to translate literally the note of one who has furnished many observations upon the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Furioso</i>, not worse than those of other critics. “The poet” (say he) “uses the oath which the Gentiles put into the mouths of the their Gods, in making them swear by the waters of Styx; an oath which was held by them as inviolable. Ariosto <em>poetically</em> puts this into the mouth of the true God, to show the unalterable firmness of his purpose!”</p>
					<p>Putting aside these indefensible scandals, it is to be observed that Ariosto too often loses himself when he touches the dangerous chord of compliment; but I can say with truth, that after a long and close consideration of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Furioso</i>, I am convinced little could safely be abridged in this extraordinary poem besides these complimentary effusions. Everything else has its use, and is conducive to some dramatic, if not poetical, effect. After being long afraid of proclaiming so bold a conclusion, I have derived great confidence from finding that such was the opinion of the late <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Fox, who used to contend that there was no such thing as an episode to the Purioso; and in the proper estimation of the term he is undoubtedly right, for nothing can be left out or altered, without injury to some other piece of the machinery. This may be extravagant and fantastical, but it is fitted to its ends and coherent in all its varieties. <a href="canto-29.xhtml#noteref-361" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

						<p>“It may not be amiss to take a little retrospect, in order to see how the matter was settled by Agramant, which seems rather to require some explanation. By the first lots that were drawn, the combatants stood thus: first, Rodomont and Rogero: fourth, Mandricardo and Marphisa. The list being prepared for the fight between Rodomont and Mandricardo, while these knights are arming themselves, a new dispute arises between them and Gradasso and Sacripant for Durindana and Frontina, which puts a stop to the expected combat between Rodomont and Mandricardo. Marphisa adds to the confusion by carrying off Brunello prisoner, whom she accuses of stealing her sword; and Rogero seeing the order of the lots disturbed, claims again his horse from Rodomont. Agramant, to settle the first dispute between Rodomont and Mandricardo, orders the cause to be determined by Doralice, who, choosing Mandricardo her former lover, quits the camp with indignation. The list now remained according to the first lots, to be entered by Rogero and Mandricardo, but Gradasso persisting still to claim Durindana from Mandricardo, Agramant proposes that lots should be again drawn to determine whether Rogero or Gradasso should first engage with Mandricardo, and, to prevent future strife, proposes that whoever draws the lot of combat, shall determine both his own claim and the claim of the knight who loses the lot; that when Rogero wins or loses, he shall not only win or lose the eagle for himself, but Gradasso shall, in right of his conquest, or in consequence of his defeat, continue to bear the shield of Hector, or relinquish the claim. In this last disposition of the lots, no provision seems to be made for the termination of Marphisa’s quarrel with Mandricardo.”</p>

					<p class="continued">The followers of the mystic philosophers in the age of Ariosto and that of Milton seem to have believed in the existence of two worlds, one of things and the other of types, perhaps from too literal an interpretation of doctrines which were purely allegorical; and it appears that some of the interpreters of the Pythagorean philosophy imagined the seventh sphere of their master to be the moon (Ariosto’s land of types). It is, at any rate, clear, that much of the mystery of the present canto, the preexistent souls, “the sisters three, and such branches of learning,” savour strongly of Platonic and Pythagorean doctrines. <a href="canto-35.xhtml#noteref-436" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Here again we have more after-inventions about Troy.

					<p>Harrington only says that his “author here follows not any true story, but a work entitled Almontes, which, notwithstanding, hath some credit, though not much:” but Hoole finds the dramatis personae among those of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Innamorato</i>, and those that “jousted in Aspramont;” and gives the following account of them: “After the Grecians had taken Troy, and put most of their prisoners to the sword, among whom was Polyxena, daughter of Priam and Hecuba, who was sacrificed at the tomb of Achilles; in order entirely to extirpate the race of Hector, they sought for Astyanax, but Andromache, to preserve his life, concealed him in a sepulchre, and took another child in her arms, with whom being found, they were both put to death. In the meantime the real Astyanax was safely conveyed, by a friend of his father, to the island of Sicily, when, being grown to man’s estate, he conquered Corinth and Argos; he established a government at Messina, and married the queen of Syracuse, but was afterward killed by treachery, and his widow being driven from the city by the Greeks, took shelter in Risa, where she was delivered of a son named Polydore, from whom descended Clovis and Constantius. Constantius was the head of the line of Pepin, father of Charlemagne; and from Clovis came Rogero, who married Galaciëlla, daughter of Agolant. Rogero being cruelly murdered and his city destroyed, his wife fled to the coast of Africa, where she was delivered of two children, a boy and a girl, and died soon after; the boy, called Rogero, was brought up by Atlantes, a magician.”⁠—See <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Orlando <abbr>Innam.</abbr></i> <abbr>b.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> <abbr>c.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr></p>
					<p>Take his further account of Rogero of Risa and Galaciëlla, the father and mother of Ariosto’s hero:</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“When Almontes left the dominions of his father Agolant to revenge the death of King Garnieri on the Christians, he took with him his sister Galaciëlla, a female warrior of great courage, but his brother Troyano remained behind with his father. Almontes and Galaciëlla alternately fought with Rogero of Risa, without victory to any party. Galaciëlla turned Christian and married Rogero; but Bertram, elder natural brother to Rogero, having conceived a passion for his sister-in-law, but unable to corrupt her chastity, he in revenge betrayed the town of Risa to Almontes, who entering by night, put all to the sword. Rogero and his father Rampaldo were killed: but Almontes afterward, repenting of the part which he had acted, caused Bertram to be put to death. Galaciëlla, then big with child, was put on board a vessel with eight attendants, whom she afterwards killed, and landing at a castle, was delivered of two children, and died.”</p>

					<p>Rogero had vowed to Bradamant, that he would, on the first reasonable pretence, leave <em>Agramant and his evil sect</em>, to serve the God and the king of his fathers. This occasion is afforded him by the perjury of Agramant, whose service he had sworn to renounce, if he should, contrary to his oath, interrupt the duel between himself and Rinaldo. Yet, in spite of all this, we find him sacrificing faith and love to loyalty, and perjuring himself in favour of a perjured king. The thing is worthy of remark, because Rogero is evidently the hero of the poem; and, from the qualities with which Ariosto has generally invested him, we may suppose was intended as his pattern of a <i xml:lang="fr">preux chevalier</i>. In ascribing to him, therefore, the sentiments and conduct which he exhibits in the text, Ariosto has probably ascribed to him the quality that was most popular in his time, and has thus unwittingly pronounced the most damning satire on the morals of his age. For allegiance to person or party, exclusive of principle, is surely the most vulgar, as well as the most exceptionable, of all generous propensities, and Rogero might probably be outdone in his equivocal generosity by many of the tenants of every gaol in Christendom. <a href="canto-40.xhtml#noteref-478" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

Another, who is also blinded, and who is also fastened to the pivot by another cord, has <em>a small bell</em> in his hand, which he occasionally rings, and which serves as a guide to the other, whose business it is to catch him; and who, if he succeeds in this, beats him with his knotted handkerchief.

					<p>There were two Maffei from Voltera, called each of them Volterrano⁠—Mario and Raffaelle. I think Ariosto speaks of the former, as he, as well as most of those mentioned in this stanza, were members of the Roman Academy, and are praised by Sadoleto in one of his letters almost in the same order as they are mentioned by Ariosto. <a href="canto-46.xhtml#noteref-569" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Biagio Pallai, who, according to the fashion of the day, on entering the Roman Academy, had his vulgar name changed into the more classically sounding name of Blosio Palladio, was an elegant Latin poet, and one of the heads of the university of Rome, the Sapienza. He was secretary to Popes Clement <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VII</span> and Paul <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span>, and in the name of the former he wrote the privilege for the corrected edition of Ariosto’s poem of 1532, dated on the 31st of January of that year. He was elected bishop of Foligno by the latter of these popes.</p>
					<p>Giampietro or (as he was called afterwards) Pierio Valeriani was an adherent of the Medici. He enjoyed the favour of Leo <span epub:type="z3998:roman">X</span>, was elected professor of literature by Clement <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VII</span>, and then trusted with the education of Ippolito and Alexander de’ Medici, two pupils who did not great credit to their masters. Pierio was a good historian, an elegant Latin poet, and a very learned man.</p>
					<p>Marco Girolamo Vida, bishop of Alba, whose poems “<i xml:lang="la">Christiados</i>,” “<i xml:lang="la">Scacchia Ludus</i>,” “<i xml:lang="la">Ars Poetica</i>,” “<i xml:lang="la">Bombices</i>,” are too well known to require any praise. He was called <i xml:lang="la">Virgilius redivivus</i>; and, if anything, he may be said to have been excessively Virgilian. His generous disposition rendered him very popular among the poor of his diocese.</p>
					<p>Marco Mussùro, a pupil of John Làscari; a man of extensive learning, rofessor at the university of Padua, and archbishop of Malvasia. A few Latin epigrams only have survived him. Erasmus says that he was “<i xml:lang="la">Latinae linguae usque admiraculum doctus: quod vix ulli Graeco contigit</i>.”</p>
					<p>Giovanni Làscari of Constantinople fled to Italy on the conquest of that city by the Turks, and was educated at Padua. His extensive learning and amiable character rendered him a favourite of Lorenzo il Magnifico, Leo <span epub:type="z3998:roman">X</span>, and Charles <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span>, as well as Francis <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> of France.</p>
					<p>Andrea Navagèro, a learned man, second to none in taste and elegance in his Latin verses, and who died at Blois in France on the 8th of May, 1529. He so much detested Martial’s poetry, on account of its obscenity, that he every year sacrificed to Vulcan a copy (some say more) of his epigrams.</p>
					<p>Andrea Marone, a man who was never equalled for his facility of making good Latin verses impromptu, and whose genius is described by Giovio as <i xml:lang="la">incredibile</i>, <i xml:lang="la">portentosum</i>. He is mentioned by our poet, above, <abbr>c.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span> <abbr>st.</abbr> 56, as equal to his namesake Virgil.</p>
					<p>The Monk Sevèro. Perhaps Severo Varino, called also Severo da Piacenza, or da Firenzuola, a learned Benedictine; or Severo da Volterra, a Benedictine also, and a poet, among whose <abbr>MSS.</abbr> there were sonnets addressed to Ariosto, as Porcacchi informs us. <a href="canto-46.xhtml#noteref-570" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Alessandro Orològi, a gentleman from Padua: (Fornari). I know nothing more of him.</p>
					<p>Alessandro Guarini, secretary to the Duke of Ferrara. He published an edition of Catullus corrected by his father, with notes of his own.</p>
					<p>Màrio Equicola d’Alvito (and not Olvìto, as all the editions of Ariosto say) took his name from the place of his birth. He wrote a history of Mantua, a treatise on poetry, and another on the nature of love. He was secretary to Isabella d’Este, Marchioness Gonzaga of Mantua, of whom Ariosto makes a splendid panegyric, canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XIII</span> <abbr>st.</abbr> 59, et <abbr>seq.</abbr>, to her husband Francis, and to her son Frederick, with whom Mario was besieged in Pavis.</p>
					<p>Piètro Aretìno.

He attacked in the most scurrilous manner all those from whom he had nothing to fear. He took his name from Arezzo, his native place, being a bastard. His father was, it is said, Luigi Bacci.</p>
					<p>Girolamo Verità is said to have been an elegant poet, and a man fond of scientific pursuits.</p>
					<p>Girolamo Cittadìno was a friend of Bembo, who, in a letter, praises two sonnets of his. He lived at Ferrara, as I learn from Bandello, in the service of Ippolita Sforza, mentioned above, <abbr>st.</abbr> 4. Giovio praises him as a good Latin poet.</p>
					<p>Niccolò Leonicèno, a distinguished physician, of great learning, an elegant writer of Latin verses, when young, and of a most pure life. He was one of the first who dared to question the authority of Pliny, and died, 96 years old, at Ferrara, in 1524.</p>
					<p>Giovanni Manardi, a physician of note. He travelled much, and was one of the first who boldly appealed to reason and observation instead of authority, as may be seen from the first of his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="la">Epistolarum Medicinalium</i>, already quoted.</p>
					<p>Benedetto Tagliacarne, or Teocrèno (as he chose to call himself), was named tutor to the son of Francis <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> of France, who appointed him to the bishopric of Grasse. Teocrèno had spoken slightly of Erasmus; and hence we may understand why Olivarius called him a pedant. He is generally considered to have been a learned man.</p>
					<p>Cèlio Calcagnini, a learned man, but an affected writer, highly esteemed by Erasmus. Before Copernicus published his astronomical system in 1543, Calcagnini published a book to demonstrate “<i xml:lang="la">quod coelum stet, terra autem moveatur</i>.” Having followed the cardinal d’Este to Hungary, he was appointed professor of literature at Ferrara on his return; whilst Ariosto, who did not like to go, lost his eminence’s good graces. Calcagnini is also praised above, canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XLII</span> <abbr>st.</abbr> 90.</p>

					<p>Bernardo Capello, a Venetian nobleman, and a pupil of Bembo. He was iniquitously banished by the Council of <span epub:type="z3998:roman">X</span> on account of his freedom of speech in the senate. He went to Rome, where he was well received by Cardinal Farnese, and died an exile. His lyric poetry is excellent. He was a poet, not a timid imitator of Petrarch.</p>
					<p>Pietro Bembo, a Venetian, whose family ranked among the very first of that proud republic. He was a learned and accomplished man, of a kind and amiable disposition. He wrote the most Ciceronian Latin, and his name stands very high in the annals of Italian literature. He deserves more credit for the patronage which he granted to literature than for his own works. He was, with Sadoleto, secretary to Leo <span epub:type="z3998:roman">X</span>; and to this excellent colleague he owed his cardinalship, as it was only by his intercession that Paul <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span> was induced to pass over Bembo’s juvenile levities. He was then bishop, first of Gubbio, and afterwards of Bergamo.</p>
					<p>Gaspar Obizzi, a friend of Bembo, who addressed to him his fifty-eighth sonnet, praising his poetry. I do not know whether he was the one who married Ginevra Malatesta, mentioned above, stanza 5.</p>
					<p>Girolamo Fracastòro, whose name is well known as that of a man who in his Latin poem <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem" xml:lang="la">De Morbo Gallico</i> vied with Virgil. Fracastòro was, moreover, a great physician, zoologist, astronomer, and geographer. He is said to have been the first to use a kind of telescope to observe the stars. He was highly respected and esteemed by all those who knew him, for his kind and generous disposition.</p>
					<p>Agostino Bevazzano, or Beazzano, a great friend of Bembo, who introduced him to Leo <span epub:type="z3998:roman">X</span>, by whom he was patronised. He was an indifferent Italian poet, but wrote very elegant Latin verses.</p>
					<p>Trifon Gabriello, of a patrician family of Venice, is celebrated as a learned and upright man. A sonnet of his to Bembo, which is printed, gives a very poor opinion of his poetical talents. Bernardo Tasso confesses himself highly indebted to his suggestions respecting his poem <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Amadigi</i>.</p>
					<p>Bernardo Tasso, father of Torquato, a distinguished lyric poet, peculiarly soft and sweet, and the author of a romanesque poem, the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Amadigi</i>, in 100 cantos, in which he tried to surpass Ariosto. Although he failed in this, the work is full of poetry. The <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Furioso</i>, the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Innamorato</i>, the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Morgante</i>, and the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Amadigi</i> are the best poems of this class.

					<p>Niccolò Tiepolo, of a patrician family of Venice, was honoured by Pope Julius <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>, who conferred upon him the degree of doctor with his own hands, as, according to Bembo, in a letter to the duchess of Ferrara, the famous Lucrezia Borgia, he had given proofs “<i xml:lang="it">d’essere il più valente disputante e filosofo che per avventura in Italia oggi sia</i>.”</p>
					<p>Niccolò Amanio is mentioned by Bandello in his first novel, who calls him “<i xml:lang="it">dotto Dottore e soavissimo poeta</i>.”</p>
					<p>Antonio Fulgoso, or Fregoso, or Campofregoso, of a patrician family of Genoa, and whese relation, Federigo Fulgoso, was mentioned in so friendly and playful a manner by Ariosto, canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XLII</span> stanza 20. Antonio wrote some Latin verses now forgotten, and was surnamed <i xml:lang="la">Fileremo</i>, on account of his fondness of seclusion.</p>
					<p>Giovanni Francesco Valerio, an illegitimate son of a nobleman of the patrician family Valerio of Venice. He was a prelate, and was put to death as a traitor to his republic, for having bribed the secretaries of the senate, and communicated the secrets of the state to the Turks. A volume of tales which he wrote was never published; and I consider it fortunate for young readers, as one may deduce from the story of <em>Fiammetta</em>, the merit of which Ariosto attributes to him.⁠—See canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXVII</span> stanza 137, and canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXVIII</span> stanza 78.

					<p>Alberto Pio, Lord of Carpi, son of a sister of Giovanni Pico, aunt of Gian Francesco. He was a learned man, and a great patron of literature. His name is connected with that of Erasmus, on account of a theological dispute which took place between them. He was accused of having excited Leo <span epub:type="z3998:roman">X</span>, to make war on the Duke of Ferrara, who eventually succeeded in depriving Pio of his dominions. It is remarkable that Ariosto, living at the court of Ferrara, could so nobly praise Pio, who appears to have been a great friend of his.</p>
					<p>Jacopo Sannazzaro, who, on entering the academy of Pontano, changed, according to the fashion of the day, his christian name for that of Azzio Sincero. He was one of the first, about the end of the fifteenth century, who returned to the elegance and sweetness of Petrarch’s language. He wrote eclogues, some describing the life and costumes of shepherds, some of fishermen:⁠—but we must remember he spoke of fishermen in the bay of Naples. He was equal to Vida, and some even say to Fracastòro, in his Latin poems, of which that <i xml:lang="la">De Partu Virginis</i> is the most celebrated, and very justly so.

					<p>Pietr’ Antonio and Jacopo Acciajuòli are highly praised by Giraldi; Jacopo more particularly, whose Latin verses were also the subject of Calcagnini’s encomiums. They were of a Florentine family, but had settled at Ferrara.</p>

She was afterwards delivered of Theseus, who, being grown up, took the sword and sandals deposited with Etra by his father, and went to Athens, where he found all the city in confusion by the machinations of Medea, who, at the arrival of Theseus, made him suspected by Egeus, and persuaded the king to destroy him at a banquet by poison; but fortunately, as the youth reached out his hand to receive the cup, Egeus perceived his sword, and, embracing him, acknowledged him for his son.”</p>
