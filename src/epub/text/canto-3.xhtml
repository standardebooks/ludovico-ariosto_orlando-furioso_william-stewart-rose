					<span>Restored to sense, the beauteous Bradamant</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Finds sage Melissa in the vaulted tomb,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And hears from her of many a famous plant</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And warrior, who shall issue from her womb.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Next, to release Rogero from the haunt</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of old Atlantes, learns how from the groom,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Brunello hight, his virtuous ring to take;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thus the knight’s and others’ fetters break.</span>

			<p>
				<span>Who will vouchsafe me voice that shall ascend</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As high as I would raise my noble theme?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who will afford befitting words, and lend</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wings to my verse, to soar the pitch I scheme?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since fiercer fire for such illustrious end,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than what was wont, may well my song beseem.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For this fair portion to my lord is due</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which sings the sires from whom his lineage grew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Than whose fair line, ’mid those by heavenly grace</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Chosen to minister this earth below,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You see not, Phoebus, in your daily race,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One that in peace or war doth fairer show;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor lineage that hath longer kept its place;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And still shall keep it, if the lights which glow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Within me, but aright inspire my soul,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While the blue heaven shall turn about the pole.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But should I seek at full its worth to blaze,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not mine were needful, but that noble lyre</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which sounded at your touch the thunderer’s praise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What time the giants sank in penal fire.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet should you instruments, more fit to raise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The votive work, bestow, as I desire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All labour and all thought will I combine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To shape and shadow forth the great design.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Till when, this chisel may suffice to scale</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The stone, and give my lines a right direction;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And haply future study may avail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To bring the stubborn labour to perfection.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Return we now to him, to whom the mail</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of hawberk, shield, and helm, were small protection:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I speak of Pinabel the Maganzeze,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who hopes the damsel’s death, whose fall he sees.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The wily traitor thought that damsel sweet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had perished on the darksome cavern’s floor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with pale visages hurried his retreat</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From that, through him contaminated door.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, thence returning, clomb into his seat:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then, like one who a wicked spirit bore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To add another sin to evil deed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bore off with him the warlike virgin’s steed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Leave we sometime the wretch who, while he layed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Snares for another, wrought his proper doom;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And turn we to the damsel he betrayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who had nigh found at once her death and tomb.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She, after rising from the rock, dismayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At her shrewd fall, and gazing through the gloom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beheld and passed that inner door, which gave</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Entrance to other and more spacious cave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For the first cavern in a second ended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fashioned in form of church, and large and square;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With roof by cunning architect extended</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On shafts of alabaster rich and rare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The flame of a clear-burning lamp ascended</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before the central altar; and the glare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Illuminating all the space about,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shone through the gate, and lit the cave without.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Touched with the sanctifying thoughts which wait</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On worthy spirit in a holy place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She prays with eager lips, and heart elate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To the Disposer of all earthly grace:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, kneeling, hears a secret wicket grate</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the opposing wall; whence, face to face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A woman issuing forth, the maid addresses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Barefoot, ungirt, and with dishevelled tresses.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O generous Bradamant,” the matron cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Know thine arrival in this hallowed hold</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was not unauthorized of heavenly guide:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the prophetic ghost of Merlin told,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou to this cave shouldst come by path untried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which covers the renowned magician’s mould.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And here have I long time awaited thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To tell what is the heavens’ pronounced decree.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“This is the ancient memorable cave</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which Merlin,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-24" id="noteref-24" epub:type="noteref">24</a> that enchanter sage, did make:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou may’st have heard how that magician brave</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was cheated by the Lady of the Lake.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Below, beneath the cavern, is the grave</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which holds his bones; where, for that lady’s sake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His limbs (for such her will) the wizard spread.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Living he laid him there, and lies there dead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Yet lives the spirit of immortal strain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lodged in the enchanter’s corpse, till to the skies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The trumpet call it, or to endless pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As it with dove or raven’s wing shall rise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet lives the voice, and thou shalt hear how plain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From its sepulchral case of marble cries:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since this has still the past and future taught</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To every wight that has its counsel sought.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Long days have passed since I from distant land</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My course did to this cemetery steer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That in the solemn mysteries I scanned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Merlin to me the truth should better clear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And having compassed the design I planned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A month beyond, for thee, have tarried here;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since Merlin, still with certain knowledge summing</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Events, prefixed this moment for thy coming.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The daughter of Duke Aymon stood aghast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And silent listened to the speech; while she</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Knew not, sore marvelling at all that passed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If ’twere a dream or a reality.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At length, with modest brow, and eyes downcast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Replied (like one that was all modesty),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“And is this wrought for me? and have I merit</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Worthy the workings of prophetic spirit?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And full of joy the adventure strange pursues,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Moving with ready haste behind the dame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who brings her to the sepulchre which mews</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The bones and spirit, erst of Merlin’s name.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The tomb, of hardest stone which masons use,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shone smooth and lucid, and as red as flame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that although no sun-beam pierced the gloom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Its splendour lit the subterraneous room.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Whether it be the native operation</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">O certain stones, to shine like torch i’ the dark,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or whether force of spell or fumigation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(A guess that seems to come more near the mark)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or sign made under mystic constellation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The blaze that came from the sepulchral ark</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Discovered sculpture, colour, gems, and gilding,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And whatsoever else adorned the building.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Scarcely had Bradamant above the sill</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lifter her foot, and trod the secret cave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When the live spirit, in clear tones that thrill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Addressed the martial virgin from the grave;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“May Fortune, chaste and noble maid, fulfil</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thine every wish!” exclaimed the wizard brave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Since from thy womb a princely race shall spring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose name through Italy and earth shall ring.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The noble blood derived from ancient Troy,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-25" id="noteref-25" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mingling in thee its two most glorious streams,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall be the ornament, and flower, and joy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of every lineage on which Phoebus beams,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where genial stars lend warmth, or cold annoy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where Indus, Tagus, Nile, or Danube gleams;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in thy progeny and long drawn line</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall marquises, counts, dukes, and Caesers shine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Captains and cavaliers shall spring from thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who both by knightly lance and prudent lore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall once again to widowed Italy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her ancient praise and fame in arms restore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in her realms just lords shall seated be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Such Numa and Augustus were of yore),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who with their government, benign and sage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall re-create on earth the golden age.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Then, that the will of Heaven be duly brought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To a fair end through thee, in fitting date,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which from the first to bless thy love has wrought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And destined young Rogero for thy mate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let nothing interpose to break that thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But boldly tread the path perscribed by fate;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor let aught stay thee till the thief be thrown</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By thy good lance, who keeps thee from thine own.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here Merlin ceased, that for the solemn feat</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Melissa might prepare with fitting spell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To show bold Bradamant, in aspect meet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The heirs who her illustrious race should swell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence many sprites she chose; but from what seat</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Evoked, I know not, or if called from hell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And gathered in one place (so bade the dame),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In various garb and guise the shadows came.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This done, into the church she called the maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where she had drawn a magic ring, as wide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As might contain the damsel, prostrate laid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With the full measure of a palm beside.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And on her head, lest spirit should invade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A pentacle for more assurance tied.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-26" id="noteref-26" epub:type="noteref">26</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So bade her hold her peace, and stand and look,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then read, and schooled the demons from her book.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lo! forth of that first cave what countless swarm</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Presses upon the circle’s sacred round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, when they would the magic rampart storm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Finds the way barred as if by fosse or mound;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then back the rabble turns of various form;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And when it thrice with bending march has wound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">About the circle, troops into the cave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where stands that beauteous urn, the wizard’s grave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“To tell at large the puissant acts and worth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And name of each who, figured in a sprite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is present to our eyes before his birth,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Said sage Melissa to the damsel bright;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“To tell the deeds which they shall act on earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were labour not to finish with the night.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence I shall call few worthies of thy line,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As time and fair occasion shall combine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“See yonder first-born of thy noble breed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who well reflects thy fair and joyous face;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, first of thine and of Rogero’s seed,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-27" id="noteref-27" epub:type="noteref">27</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall plant in Italy thy generous race.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In him behold who shall distain the mead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And his good sword with blood of Pontier base;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The mighty wrong chastised, and traitor’s guilt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By whom his princely father’s blood was spilt.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“By him King Desiderius shall be pressed,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-28" id="noteref-28" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The valiant leader of the Lombard horde:</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Italy, with arms and belted sword:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who shall defend the church from barbarous foes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And more than once assure her safe repose.</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such new instructions for the future way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That thou no more shalt need Melissa’s stay.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>All night the maid reposes in the cave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the best part in talk with Merlin spends;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While with persuasive voice the wizard grave</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To her Rogero’s honest love commends;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till from the vault goes forth that virgin brave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As through the sky the rising sun ascends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By path, long space obscure on either side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The weird woman still her faithful guide.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They gain a hidden glen, which heights inclose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And mountains inaccessible to man:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And they all day toil on, without repose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where precipices frowned and torrents ran.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And (what may some diversion interpose)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sweet subjects of discourse together scan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In conference, which best might make appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The rugged road less dismal and severe.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of these the greater portion served to guide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Such the wise woman’s scope) the warlike dame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And teach by what device might be untied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero’s gyves, if steadfast were her flame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“If thou wert Mars himself, or Pallas,” cried</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sage Melissa; “though with thee there came</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More than King Charles or Agramant command,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against the wizard foe thou could’st not stand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Besides that it is walled about with steel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And inexpugnable his tower, and high;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Besides that his swift horse is taught to wheel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And caracol and gallop in mid sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He bears a mortal shield of power to seal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As soon as ’tis exposed, the dazzled eye;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And so invades each sense the splendour shed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he who sees the blaze remains as dead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And lest to shut thine eyes, thou should’st suppose</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Might serve, contending with the wizard knight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How would’st thou know, when both in combat close,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When he strikes home, or when eschews the fight?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But to escape the blaze which blinds his foes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And render vain each necromantic sleight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Have here a speedy mean which cannot miss;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor can the world afford a way but this.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“King Agramant of Africa a ring.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thieved from an Indian queen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-67" id="noteref-67" epub:type="noteref">67</a> by subtle guiles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has to a baron of his following</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Consigned, who now precedes us by few miles;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Brunello he. Who wears the gift shall bring</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To nought all sorceries and magic wiles.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In thefts and cheats Brunello is as well</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Instructed, as the sage in charm and spell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Brunello, he so practised and so sly</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As now I tell thee, by his king is sent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he with aid of mother wit may try,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And of this ring, well proved in like event,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To take Rogero from the castle high;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So has he boasted, by the wizard pent:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to his lord such promise did impart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who has Rogero’s presence most at heart.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“That his escape to thee alone may owe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not to the king, the youthful cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How to release Rogero from his foe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And his enchanted cage, prepare to hear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Three days along the shingle shalt thou go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beside the sea, whose waves will soon appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thee the third day shall to a hostel bring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where he shall come who bears the virtuous ring.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“That thou may’st recognise the man, in height</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Less than six palms, observe one at this inn</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of black and curly hair, the dwarfish wight!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beard overgrown about the cheek and chin;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With shaggy brow, swoln eyes, and cloudy sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A nose close flattened, and a sallow skin;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To this, that I may make my sketch complete,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Succinctly clad, like courier, goes the cheat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Thy conversation with this man shall turn</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon enchantment, spell, and mystic pact:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thou shalt, in thy talk, appear to yearn</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To prove the wizard’s strength, as is the fact.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, lady, let him not thy knowledge learn</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of his good ring, which mars all magic act:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He shall propose to bring thee as a guide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To the tall castle, whither thou would’st ride.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Follow him close, and viewing (for a sign),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now near, the fortress of the enchanter hoar;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let no false pity there thy mind incline</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To stay the execution of my lore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Give him his death; but let him not divine</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thy thought, nor grant him respite; for before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thine eyes, concealed by it, the caitiff slips</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If once he place the ring between his lips.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Discoursing thus, they came upon the sea</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where Garonne near fair Bordeaux meets the tide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here, fellow travellers no more to be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some natural tears they drop and then divide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Duke Aymon’s child, who slumbers not till she</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Release her knight, holds on till eventide:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twas then the damsel at a hostel rested,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where Sir Brunello was already guested.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The maid Brunello knows as soon as found</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(So was his image on her mind impressed),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And asks him whence he came, and whither bound;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he replies and lies, as he is pressed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The dame, who is forewarned, and knows her ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Feigns too as well as he, and lies her best:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And changes sex and sect, and name and land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And her quick eye oft glances at his hand;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oft glances at his resless hand, in fear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he might undetected make some prize;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor ever lets the knave approach too near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well knowing his condition: In this guise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The couple stand together, when they hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A sudden sound: but what that sound implies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I, sir, shall tell hereafter with its cause;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But first shall break my song with fitting pause.</span>
